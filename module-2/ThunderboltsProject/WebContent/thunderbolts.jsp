    <h1>The Thunderbolts: A Look Through Mental Health</h1>
    <p>
        The Thunderbolts* features a group of morally complex characters in the Marvel universe.
        Each one has a troubled past, making the film a great backdrop to explore mental health themes such as trauma, redemption, and resilience.
        As someone who has struggled most of his life with mental health issues, I felt that this film brought mental health to the big screen, and 
        exposed it to a wider audience.
